# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 🚀 Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn using various machine learning models. Churn prediction helps businesses retain customers by identifying those at risk of leaving. We employ multiple models to analyze the Telco Customer Churn Dataset and evaluate their performance.


## 🔹 Key Features:

Customer Information: Gender, Partner, Dependents

Subscription Details: PhoneService, InternetService, Streaming, etc.

Billing Details: MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, Contract Type

Target Variable: Churn (Yes/No - whether a customer churned or not)


## 📌 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Importing Libraries
2️⃣ Loading & Exploring Data
3️⃣ Data Preprocessing
4️⃣ Splitting Data
5️⃣ Model Training

## Models used:

### 🌲 Random Forest

Ensemble of decision trees, robust to overfitting

### 📈 Logistic Regression

Simple linear model for binary classification

### 🌳 Decision Tree

Splits data based on conditions, prone to overfitting

### 🏆 Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Finds optimal hyperplane for classification

### 🔍 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Classifies based on nearest data points

### 🧮 Naïve Bayes

Probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem

### 🔗 Neural Network (MLPClassifier)

Multi-layer perceptron for deep learning

6️⃣ Model Evaluation

Each model is assessed using:

Accuracy Score

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

Confusion Matrix (Visualized using seaborn heatmaps)

ROC-AUC Score (if applicable)

## 📊 Results

Accuracy scores and evaluation metrics are displayed for each model.

A confusion matrix heatmap is plotted for better visualization.
